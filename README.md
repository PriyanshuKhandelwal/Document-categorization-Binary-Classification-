# Document categorization (Binary Classification):
Here we will be using document sets of two different categories and will try to classify them based on the content they hold. We will be using both `Naive Bayes`, `Support Vector Machines` and `Random Forest` algorithm for this classification.

Here we will be using document set of **Hockey** and **Baseball** based article set. 
* Preprocessing the data
* Merging our datasets and building featureset
    * Randomizing
    * Gathering all words together
    * Building feature set
* Creating and training our model
* Support Vector Machines
    * Fine tuning
* Random Forest
## Conclusion:
We have used here three categorization algorithms namely `Naive Bayes`, `Support Vector Machines` and `Random Forest`. We were already able to achieve approx 100% accuracy in `Naive Bayes` . For the remaining two algorithms we need to tweak the hyper parameters and we could achieve 100% accuracy.
